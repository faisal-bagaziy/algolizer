## Description üå†
Algolizer is a web application that allows users to visualize algorithms in action. The application provides a variety of algorithms to choose from, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and graph algorithms. Users can select an algorithm and see a step-by-step visualization of how the algorithm works on a sample input.


## Prerequisites üë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Before using Algolizer, you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript and web development. Additionally, you should have the following prerequisites installed:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.j
You can download Node.js and npm from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

## Getting Started üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
