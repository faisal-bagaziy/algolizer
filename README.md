## Description 🌠
Algolizer is a web application that allows users to visualize algorithms in action. The application provides a variety of algorithms to choose from, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and graph algorithms. Users can select an algorithm and see a step-by-step visualization of how the algorithm works on a sample input.


## Prerequisites 👷🏽‍♂️
